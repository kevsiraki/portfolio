            I am currently working on several personal projects, including the IoT Environment Analysis API, a REST API designed for data analysis. This API is thoroughly tested with J-Unit and documented using Swagger. It receives JSON payloads from ESP32 MCUs, which are deserialized and stored in a MySQL database. To optimize performance, I have implemented schema normalization, Redis for caching, and pagination, resulting in a reduction of API response latency by approximately 50 ms per 100 KB response size.
