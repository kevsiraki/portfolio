        <h2>Master Control Panel and Multimedia Devices</h2>
        <p>
            In each classroom, there is usually a master on/off switch for multimedia devices such as TVs. This switch
            is typically located next to a master control panel for all AV (audiovisual) devices in the room. If you
            encounter any issues accessing or controlling the TV or other multimedia devices using the remote control,
            or if further debugging is needed, the master control panel can be a valuable resource. It allows for
            centralized control and troubleshooting of all AV equipment in the classroom, providing quick and efficient
            solutions to any technical problems that may arise.

        <h2>Types of Display Cables</h2>
        <p>
            There are several types of display cables commonly used to connect devices to displays. Here are some of the
            most common ones:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>HDMI (High-Definition Multimedia Interface):</strong> HDMI cables transmit high-definition audio
                and video signals between devices, such as laptops, DVD players, gaming consoles, and TVs. They support
                both audio and video transmission in a single cable, making them popular for connecting modern
                multimedia devices.</li>
            <li><strong>VGA (Video Graphics Array):</strong> VGA cables are analog cables primarily used to connect
                older computers, projectors, and displays. While they can transmit video signals, VGA cables do not
                carry audio, and their resolution capabilities are limited compared to HDMI cables.</li>
            <li><strong>DVI (Digital Visual Interface):</strong> DVI cables transmit digital video signals between
                devices, such as computers and monitors. They come in different variants, including DVI-D
                (digital-only), DVI-I (integrated digital and analog), and DVI-A (analog-only). DVI cables support
                higher resolutions than VGA cables but do not transmit audio.</li>
            <li><strong>AV (Audio/Video) Cables:</strong> AV cables, also known as composite or RCA cables, consist of
                three connectors: red (right audio), white (left audio), and yellow (video). They are commonly used to
                connect DVD players, VCRs, gaming consoles, and other audiovisual equipment to TVs and monitors.
                However, AV cables offer lower-quality video compared to HDMI or VGA cables and are gradually being
                phased out in favor of digital connections.</li>
            <li><strong>DisplayPort:</strong> DisplayPort cables are digital cables designed for connecting computers
                and displays, supporting high resolutions and refresh rates. They can transmit both audio and video
                signals and are commonly found on modern laptops, desktop computers, and monitors.</li>
            <li><strong>Thunderbolt:</strong> Thunderbolt cables are high-speed cables used primarily for connecting
                peripherals, such as external hard drives, monitors, and docks, to computers. They support data
                transfer, video output, and power delivery, making them versatile for various multimedia applications.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Each type of display cable has its advantages and limitations, so it's essential to choose the right cable
            based on your specific devices and requirements.
